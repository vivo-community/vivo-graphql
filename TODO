TODO List

1. make way to load reference data - from n3 file, or csv
   or json files (not sure which one)
2. write test - starting (TestMain) with reloading reference data
    a. might use docker-compose-test.yml to start elastic instance
    b. test functions to add/update data work
3. make resolvers interchangeable to (non-existent) solr index functions
4. make mutations - and validation of incoming json
    a. should list errors (maybe) - instead of just first error
    b. should be able to efficiently batch (as elastic does) - not sure how
       to return errors then (or if it fails as transaction?)
5. Fill out more mutation/validation fields for person object (people)
6. *.bat file versions of *.sh files for Windows developers
   or just all docker all the time?
7. Or way to develop either locally or using docker - maybe shell
   script to call into docker build (would then need *.bat and 
   *.sh files)
8.
